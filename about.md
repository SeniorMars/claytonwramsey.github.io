Hi!
I'm a PhD student studying computer science at Rice University.
In my free time, I figure skate, swing dance, and write a little code.

My biggest project is Fiddler, a chess engine.
Check it out [here](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/fiddler)!.

This website was designed using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and themed with
[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
The source code for the site is [here](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/claytonwramsey.github.io).
