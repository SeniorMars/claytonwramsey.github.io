Hi!
I'm a PhD student studying computer science at Rice University.
In my free time, I figure skate, swing dance, and write a little code.

My biggest project is Fiddler, a chess engine.
Check it out [here](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/fiddler)!.

This website was designed using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and themed with
[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
The source code for the site is [here](https://github.com/claytonwramsey/claytonwramsey.github.io).
If you find something broken, incorrect, or just plain bad about my site, send me an email or open
an issue!

Also, feel free to reach out to me about anything.
I'd love to make new friends :).
