      Hi! Iâ€™m a PhD student studying computer science at Rice University. In my
      free time, I figure skate, swing dance, and write a little code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of my research focuses on algorithmic robotics, but in my free time
      (not much of that these days) I work on chess engines. I've been working
      on my current engine, Fiddler, for a few years. Check it out
      <a href="https://github.com/claytonwramsey/fiddler">here!</a>
