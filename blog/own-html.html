  Hi! Thanks for checking out this website. 
  I made it myself! 
  This website was made by hand. 
  I intentionally haven't minified anything so you can see how it all fits together.

    <h1>Writing my own damn HTML</h1>
    <p>The future of the web doesn't have to be webapp frameworks and cookie prompts.</p>
    <p>
      This week, I rewrote my website from scratch. Earlier, I had used
      <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate my website, but I had gotten sick of
      it. In particular, I didn't like having to add hack upon hack to get things to render the way
      I wanted to, I didn't like the hacky build system, and I didn't like having to debug the
      mishmash of mismatched versions, outdated documentation, and broken Ruby environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all, I think it's been a really fun experience! To be completely honest, I think that
      building this site in vanilla HTML was <em>easier</em> than doing it with Jekyll. The only
      thing I really miss is writing up my blog posts in Markdown, because I can write a little
      faster in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, I think that everyone in the business of having a personal website should
      consider writing their own HTML - maybe we actually got it right in the nineties.
      <s>In this essay, I will</s> I'll explain in further detail below.
    </p>
    <h2>It's not as hard as you think it is</h2>
    <p>
      HTML, at heart, is a very simple format. It's a little ugly, but that didn't stop us from
      using C++ either. Shipping your website is as simple as serving some webpages. If you're like
      me, and just serving some text and pictures, it's not worth the effort of minifying your HTML
      to save a whole kilobyte of data - you can just serve a page as you edited it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the main monotonous part of working with raw HTML is the stuff that's common across
      pages - things like the header and footer on this very website.
