## Background

If you're familiar with the details of Rust and its standard library, feel free to skip this
section.

The core backing behind Rust's memory model is _affine typing_ and the _borrow checker_.
Values may only be bound to one variable at a time, and borrows (a.k.a. references) may not outlive
the scope binding their referent.

For example, the following code is invalid:

```rust
let x = vec![1, 2, 3];
let y = x;
println!("{x:?}"); // compile error - x has already been moved
```

Normally, we work around this by borrowing against a binding, such as by making `y = &x` in the
example above.
However, we often need to share some heap-allocated value without knowing which binding will live
the longest.
The solution to this problem is shared ownership via garbage collection.

Rust's standard library offers two simple reference-counted garbage collectors: the single-threaded
[`Rc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/index.html) and its atomically-indexed counterpart
[`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html).
They operate by maintining a reference count in each heap allocation.
Under most circumstances, these work great, but they can't handle cyclic references.
Combined with interior mutability, it's trivial to refute them.

```rust
use std::{cell::OnceCell, rc::Rc};
struct Foo(OnceCell<Rc<Foo>>);

let x = Rc::new(Foo(OnceCell::new()));
x.0.set(Rc::clone(&x));
// My foo has a reference to itself. It can never be freed!
```
